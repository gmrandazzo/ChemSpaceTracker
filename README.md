# ChemSpaceTracker: The Chemical Space Navigator!


ChemSpaceTraker is an unsupervised tool able to qualitatively and quantitatively navigate the chemical space of small molecules.

SMILES strings are interpreted in a more readable visual output. 

The main idea behind ChemSpaceTracker is to track similar molecules which can possess similar activity/properties.

The software is generally utilized in Virtual Screening or High Throughput Screening procedures to enhance the drug discovery success rate!
